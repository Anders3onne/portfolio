    <p> I am a student at Moringa school, I am a woman with a strong ambition to be a software developer. Now we have been studying for a month and two weeks now, it has not been easy but it truly is worth it.
        Through a section we have called Thursday speaker, a female speaker inspired /encouraged us to pursue software development that it is not just a field for men.She talked about a lady called Ada Lovelace who was the first person to publish an algorithm intended to be executed by the first modern computer.
        As a result she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.This really inspied us to keep pushing harder and have no fear since there are other awesome women doing the same.
        Through out this project i worked on a few projects but to name a few:
    <ol>
        <li><em>Cookie Recipe</em>: this is a project that talks about food which i am a big fan of and gives awesome ingredients on how to make cookies. For further info.<a href= https://anders3onne.github.io/recipe>Read more</a></li>
