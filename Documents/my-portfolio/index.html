<h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
<p> 
    I am a student at Moringa school, I am a woman with a strong ambition to be a software developer. Now we have been studying for a month and two weeks now, it has not been easy but it truly is worth it.
    Through a section we have called Thursday speaker, a female speaker inspired /encouraged us to pursue software development that it is not just a field for men.She talked about a lady called Ada Lovelace who was the first person to publish an algorithm intended to be executed by the first modern computer.
    As a result she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.This really inspied us to keep pushing harder and have no fear since there are other awesome women doing the same.</p>
